      <description>In compiled languages, such as C++, developpers have the possibility to use and build shared libraries, also known as a dynamic libraries. To depend on a shared library (in an exectuable or another shared library), said library needs to be present at compile time, 1 but really symbols from the library (functions, types, global variables etc.) are resolved at runtime (when something is executed) by the dynamic linker.
Shared libraries have many advantages.</description>
